# ðŸ›  Technical Plan for Simulation Data Generation

This document provides a comprehensive technical description of the data generation mechanism in **FÂ²-Gen**, an open-source platform for simulating scenario-based financial fraud datasets.

To learn about the underlying simulation engine, see the [FÂ²-Gen Engine](engine.html). For hands-on use, refer to the [Usage Guide](usage.html).

## 1. Overview

The module is designed to generate test datasets for financial fraud detection, covering both normal and abnormal transactions.

---

## 2. Technical Architecture

The system consists of four layers:

1. **Database Layer** â€“ Stores user, merchant, card, and transaction data.
2. **Data Access Layer** â€“ Interfaces with the database and serves the service layer.
3. **Service Layer** â€“ Provides services to the data generation modules.
4. **Data Generation Layer** â€“ Generates both normal and abnormal transactions.

## 3. Data Generation Pipeline

The generation process begins with creating base data (users, merchants, bank cards), followed by parallel generation of normal and abnormal transactions.

## 4. Base Data Generation

### 4.1 User Generation

Users are generated based on attributes like age, gender, occupation, and salary.

- Age: Sampled based on predefined distribution.
- Occupation: Sampled based on proportion and average salary.
- Salary: Derived from occupation salary range.
- Gender: Randomly assigned.

### 4.2 Merchant Generation

Merchants are generated using industry type, business hours, and spending range.

- Industry category and subcategory: Sampled from probability distribution.
- Business hours: Sampled probabilistically.
- Terminal ID and merchant ID: Randomly assigned.
- Spending range: Sampled according to industry norms.

### 4.3 Bank Card Generation

Card properties include card number, type, brand, and product.

- Card count: Mapped from salary level.
- Brand and product: Based on occupation and card distribution.
- Card grade: Derived from salary bracket.

---

## 5. Normal Transaction Generation

### 5.1 Consumption Simulation

- Users are assigned daily transaction frequency, consumption type, and levels.
- Transaction time and amount are sampled from configurations.

### 5.2 Transfer Simulation

- A user relationship graph is built (e.g., family).
- Transfers are generated between 1-hop and 2-hop neighbors.

---

## 6. Abnormal Scenario Simulation

### 6.1 Credit Card Cash-out

A three-stage fraud: identify suspects â†’ simulate cash-out behavior â†’ fund return via merchant transfer.

---

### 6.2 Gambling Violation

Users act as gamblers or money mules, simulating illegal transactions through platforms.

![Gambling Generation](assets/gambling%20generation.png)

- Gambling user â†’ gambling platform â†’ underground bank
- Fake users act as transfer relays
- Rented accounts split incoming funds to conceal origins

---

### 6.3 Scalper Marketing Fraud

Airdrop exploitation by scalpers simulating multiple low-value voucher purchases.

![Scalper Generation](assets/scalper%20generation.png)

- Fraudulent users receive micro-transfers from normal users
- Small amount, high frequency, often during marketing campaign windows

---

### 6.4 Fake Registration Fraud

Simulates account takeover and unauthorized registrations using victim identity.

![Fake Registration](assets/fake%20registration.png)

Includes:
- ATM withdrawal using fake identity
- Simulated POS transactions
- Illegal transfers and spending with cloned accounts

---

### 6.5 Merchant Violation Simulation

Models fraudulent merchant behavior such as terminal tampering or irregular billing.

![Merchant Violation](assets/merchant%20violation.png)

- Merchants labeled with different fraud types
- Custom logic per fraud type controls amount, timing, and terminal behavior

---

### 6.6 Abnormal Transfer (Telecom Fraud)

Victims wire money to scam groups, followed by laundering and distribution.

![Abnormal Transfer](assets/abnormal%20transfer.png)

- Victim transfers â†’ fraud ringâ€™s receiving accounts
- Fund is split and distributed among ring members over time

---

## âœ… Notes

- All fraud simulation is parameterized and supports batch data export.
