# FinancialFraudDataGenerator
FF Data Generator - A open source Financial Fraud Detection Data Generator Web Application

This repository contains the open-source implementation of a financial transaction risk simulation tool. The system is designed to generate large-scale synthetic datasets for modeling and evaluating fraud detection algorithms under multiple abnormal scenarios.

## Features

- **Multi-scenario Simulation**: Supports six categories of risk behavior, including:
  - Credit card cash-out fraud
  - Gambling-related transactions
  - Promotional abuse by scalpers
  - Fake account registration
  - Merchant-side anomalies
  - Telecom-related abnormal transfers

- **Parametric Data Generation**: Each scenario supports user-specified configurations such as user count, transaction frequency, merchant group behavior, time patterns, and noise levels.

- **Synthetic Data Export**: Output data is stored in structured formats and ready for downstream analysis, visualization, or ML model training.

- **Modular Architecture**: The system is built with a clear layered structure, separating data access, logic control, and generation engines. Easy to extend for new scenarios.
